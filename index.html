      <p>So, it’s 6 months…and it’s still settling in, the emotions, the moments, everything. Everything feels like magic, your smile, your goofy vibe, the way you try to get me. In a world that moves so fast, I love being with you. I feel calm in your presence and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else but here, with you. When something makes me happy, the very first person I want to share it with is you. When I feel low or things don’t make sense, it’s you I want to run to and not for answers, but just to be heard, to feel okay again. Even in the quiet moments, when I’m doing absolutely nothing, my mind somehow finds its way to you. It’s not just a habit now tbh it’s comfort, it’s connection, that’s how deeply I feel for you. You brought a kind of warmth I didn’t even realize I was missing. You became the soft place where I could rest my heart. You make me feel seen, heard, and loved and that, more than anything, is why I love you the way I do. I like the way you laugh at the silliest things, and how your eyes light up with pure passion when you talk about something you love. I like how you care, even if you don’t always say it out loud. I like how you're both, strong and soft at once. It's the way you carry yourself with this perfect mix of chaos and calm. There are many reasons why I like you, but that’s the thing…It’s not just about reasons, it’s a feeling and no matter how hard I try, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fully put that feeling into words. But if there’s one thing I’m sure of, it’s you. I choose you. In this moment, and in every one after. Happy 6 months, my love. Here’s to everything we’ve shared and everything still waiting for us❤🧿</p>
